# Design Patterns

This series of short videos is dedicated to explaining **software design patterns**, using practical examples in both **Python** and **C#**. Each video will cover a specific pattern, accompanied by diagrams created with **Mermaid** to visually illustrate its structure and behavior. The goal is to provide a quick and clear understanding of key concepts, making it easier to apply them in real-world projects.

## Project Structure

- **Short Videos**: Each design pattern will be explained in a short vertical-format video.
- **Long Videos**: Longer videos will group design patterns into categories (creational, structural, behavioral).
- **Articles**: We'll write articles to dive deeper into the patterns and their implementations.
- **Infographics**: Each design pattern will have an infographic for quick visual reference.
