# State

The **State** pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is useful when an object can have different behaviors depending on its state and needs to change dynamically between them.

## Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Context {
        +request()
        +setState(State state)
    }

    class State {
        +handle(Context context)
    }

    class ConcreteStateA {
        +handle(Context context)
    }

    class ConcreteStateB {
        +handle(Context context)
    }

    Context o--> State
    State <|-- ConcreteStateA
    State <|-- ConcreteStateB
```

## Example

In this directory, you can find examples of how to implement the pattern in **C#** and **Python**, as well as a **Mermaid** diagram illustrating the basic structure of the pattern.

- **C#**: Example with classes implementing the State pattern to dynamically change an object's behavior based on its state.
- **Python**: A similar example that shows how objects change their behavior based on their state.
